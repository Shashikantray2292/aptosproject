# PredictionMarket Smart Contract

## Vision

The **PredictionMarket** smart contract enables the creation and management of prediction markets on the Aptos blockchain. It allows users to create prediction events, place bets on the outcomes, and manage tokens associated with these predictions. The contract provides a decentralized platform for speculative betting on various events, enhancing user engagement through financial incentives.

## Features

- **Create Event**:

  - Allows users to create a new prediction event where participants can place bets on potential outcomes.
  - Initializes the event with no bets placed and no resolved outcome.

- **Place Prediction**:
  - Users can place a prediction on an event by betting tokens on either "Yes" or "No" outcomes.
  - Tokens are deposited into the event's account, and the event's total bets for each outcome are updated accordingly.

## Future Scope

1. **Event Resolution**:

   - Implement functionality to resolve events and determine outcomes, updating the state of the event.

2. **Payout Mechanism**:

   - Develop a payout mechanism to distribute tokens based on the event outcome and the amount bet on each prediction.

3. **Event Creation with Metadata**:

   - Allow the addition of metadata to events, such as descriptions, expiration dates, and categories.

4. **Betting Limits**:

   - Introduce limits on the amount that can be bet on each outcome to manage risk and ensure fair play.

5. **Decentralized Dispute Resolution**:
   - Implement mechanisms for resolving disputes regarding event outcomes or betting discrepancies.

The **PredictionMarket** contract aims to create a robust and transparent platform for prediction betting, driving engagement and providing a unique way to speculate on future events within the Aptos ecosystem.
